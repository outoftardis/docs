# RST Templates for API Documentation

This repository contains [templates](templates) for API documentation written in reStructuredText (RST). 

We are also going to provide [auxiliary scripts](scripts) that might be used to automate some steps of the build process. However, no scripts are avaialable at the moment.

## Overview

The [guidelines](templates/README.md) describe which templates to use and in which case. Each project would need a different set of templates depending on whether or not it uses Doxygen, what the structure of the library is, and other project-specific details.

Our goal is to create a similar look-and-feal across API documentation for different libraries and to make it easier for projects to start using Sphinx and reStructuredText markup for their API documentation.


Browse [our GitHub Pages](https://outoftardis.github.io/docs/) to see the output of these templates.
