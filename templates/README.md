# Guidelines


## Terminology

To create a glossary of terms used across your API documentation, choose one of the following templates:

- [terminology.tmpl](), where all terms are listed alphabetically within a single list
- [teminology_with_sections.tmpl](), where terms are split across multiple thematic lists and sorted alphabetically within each one

These terms could be referenced from other topics in your API documentation using `:term:` directive.
